🌐 Acad-Arena
Discover • Compete • Collaborate • Showcase

Acad-Arena is a smart student platform that aggregates real-time academic and technical events from colleges across the world. It helps students discover competitions, form teams, track participation, and showcase achievements — all in one place.

🚀 Problem Statement

Students often miss valuable symposiums, hackathons, and competitions due to:

Scattered event information across multiple websites
